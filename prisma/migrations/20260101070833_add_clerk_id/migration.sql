/*
  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the column `password` on the `users` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[clerkId]` on the table `users` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Added the required column `clerkId` to the `users` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
